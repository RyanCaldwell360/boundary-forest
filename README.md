This notebook is an implementation of Boundary Forest Algorithm([Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.02867.pdf)) 

Above paper was published at Proc. of the 29th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) by Disney Research

The speed of this algorithm makes it appropriate for applications
such as real-time machine learning, and metric
learning.
